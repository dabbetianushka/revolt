# ReVolt

**Trade in your old electronics. Earn points. Buy new for less.**

live link-[https://revolt-2.onrender.com](https://revolt-2.onrender.com)

ReVolt is a buy-and-sell platform for electronics. Users list their old devices with photos, earn reward points based on the device's value, and redeem those points to get a discount on new products from the same store. A delivery agent verifies the old device at handover, and every order update is emailed to the customer automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Register** with name, phone number and email. Both are verified with an OTP.
2. **List your old device** with its details (brand, model, age, condition, IMEI) and photos.
3. **Earn points.** The valuation engine converts the device's estimated value into reward points, which are held until the device is verified.
4. **Shop.** Add new products to the cart and apply points at checkout to reduce the price.
5. **Delivery and verification.** The agent delivers the new product and inspects the old device against your photos and details.
   - **Match:** points are finalized and you keep the discount.
   - **Mismatch:** the agent still collects the old device, the held points are cancelled, and you pay the full price of the new product.
6. **Stay informed.** Order confirmation, shipping and delivery updates arrive by email.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | Java 17+, Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA / Hibernate, Spring Mail |
| Build tool | Maven |
| Database | MySQL or PostgreSQL |
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no framework) |
| Email | SMTP (Gmail for development, SendGrid or Brevo for production), Thymeleaf templates |
| OTP | SMS provider (Twilio, MSG91 or Firebase) and email OTP |
| Payments | Razorpay (test mode) |
| File storage | Local disk or Cloudinary / S3 |

> The backend is **Java only**. The frontend is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript that talks to the backend through REST APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17 or later
- Maven 3.8+
- MySQL 8 or PostgreSQL 14+
- A Gmail account with an App Password (or another SMTP provider) for emails
- A modern browser

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd revolt
```

### 2. Create the database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE revolt;
```

### 3. Configure the backend
Edit `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### 4. Run the backend
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The API starts at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 5. Run the frontend
Open `frontend/index.html` through a local server such as the VS Code Live Server extension (port 5500), or:
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 5500
```
Then visit `http://localhost:5500`.

---

## Configuration

`application.properties` (use environment variables for secrets, and never commit real credentials):

```properties
server.port=8080

# Database
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/revolt
spring.datasource.username=${DB_USER}
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD}
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# JWT
app.jwt.secret=${JWT_SECRET}
app.jwt.expiration-ms=86400000

# Email (SMTP)
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=${MAIL_USER}
spring.mail.password=${MAIL_APP_PASSWORD}
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true

# File uploads
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=5MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=30MB
app.upload.dir=uploads/

# CORS
app.cors.allowed-origins=http://localhost:5500

# Points
app.points.rate=1
app.points.max-redeem-percent=50
```

## Frontend and Backend Integration

- All frontend calls go through `js/api.js`, which sets the base URL (`http://localhost:8080/api`), attaches the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, and handles errors in one place.
- CORS is configured in the backend `config` package to allow the frontend origin.
- Email notifications are triggered on the **backend** whenever an order or trade-in status changes, so the frontend never has to send emails itself.
- Error responses use a consistent JSON shape:
```json
{ "timestamp": "...", "status": 400, "error": "Bad Request", "message": "Details here" }
```

## Order and Trade-in Lifecycle

```
PLACED -> CONFIRMED -> PACKED -> SHIPPED -> OUT_FOR_DELIVERY -> DELIVERED
                                                                   |
                                          +------------------------+------------------------+
                                          |                                                 |
                                TRADE-IN VERIFIED                                   TRADE-IN MISMATCH
                                (points finalized)                      (points cancelled, full price charged)
```

Orders can also move to `CANCELLED` or `RETURNED` according to the refund policy.

---

## Email Notifications

Emails are sent asynchronously with retry, and each one is recorded in an `email_logs` table.

- Registration and email verification
- OTP codes and password reset
- Device listing submitted and points credited (on hold)
- Order placed, confirmed and payment received
- Packed, shipped (with tracking info), out for delivery, delivered
- Trade-in verified and points finalized
- Trade-in mismatch, with the revised amount and reason
- Order cancelled or refunded
- Points expiry reminders

---

## Business Rules

- Points are credited as **on hold** and become final only after the agent verifies the device.
- A maximum percentage of any order can be paid with points (admin configurable).
- The trade-in quote is price-locked for 7 days.
- On a full mismatch, held points are cancelled and the customer pays the full price of the new product.
- On a partial mismatch, points are adjusted instead of cancelled entirely.
- Customers can raise a dispute within 48 hours of a mismatch, with evidence.
- Passwords are hashed with BCrypt. Phone numbers are masked in agent and tracking views.

---

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** auth with OTP, device listing, valuation, points wallet, catalog, cart, checkout, orders, email notifications, admin basics
- **Phase 2:** agent portal, mismatch report, disputes, trust score, loyalty tiers, referrals, price alerts
- **Phase 3:** refurbished marketplace, support chat, multi-language, dark mode, analytics
